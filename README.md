second homework assignment


i worked a lot on this assignment. im having a hard time with HTML and CSS but i have been going to office hours before and after class every day and using my tutoring as much as i can. i plan to continue working on this assignment, i'm just submitting this as is so i have something to submit with the hopes i'm not judged too harshly.

my code was an absolute mess but my fellow students Levi and Michael Woodward helped me a lot.
